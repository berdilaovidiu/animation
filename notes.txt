Improvements :

- simple animations can be composed into more complex animations
- support for transformations (translations, rotations, scaling)
- effects can be added like blur, disolve, glow
- non linear time functions can be added
- offer a nice and generic API
- make an absteraction of time, time function and resolution (provide them as configurable properties)
- write tests
- provide nice examples
- get inspiration from other animation APIs (jquery and netbeans for example)
